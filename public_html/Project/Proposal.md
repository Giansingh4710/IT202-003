### Intructions

#### Don't delete this

1. Pick one project type
2. Create a proposal.md file in the root of your project directory of your GitHub repository
3. Copy the contents of the Google Doc into this readme file
4. Convert the list items to markdown checkboxes (apply any other markdown for organizational purposes)
5. Create a new Project Board on GitHub
   - Choose the Automated Kanban Board Template
   - For each major line item (or sub line item if applicable) create a GitHub issue
   - The title should be the line item text
   - The first comment should be the acceptance criteria (i.e., what you need to accomplish for it to be "complete")
   - Leave these in "to do" status until you start working on them
   - Assign each issue to your Project Board (the right-side panel)
   - Assign each issue to yourself (the right-side panel)
6. As you work
7. As you work on features, create separate branches for the code in the style of Feature-ShortDescription (using the Milestone branch as the source)
8. Add, commit, push the related file changes to this branch
9. Add evidence to the PR (Feat to Milestone) conversation view comments showing the feature being implemented
   - Screenshot(s) of the site view (make sure they clearly show the feature)
   - Screenshot of the database data if applicable
   - Describe each screenshot to specify exactly what's being shown
   - A code snippet screenshot or reference via GitHub markdown may be used as an alternative for evidence that can't be captured on the screen
10. Update the checklist of the proposal.md file for each feature this is completing (ideally should be 1 branch/pull request per feature, but some cases may have multiple)

    - Basically add an x to the checkbox markdown along with a date after
      - (i.e., - [x] (mm/dd/yy) ....) See Template above
    - Add the pull request link as a new indented line for each line item being completed
    - Attach any related issue items on the right-side panel

11. Merge the Feature Branch into your Milestone branch (this should close the pull request and the attached issues)

    - Merge the Milestone branch into dev, then dev into prod as needed
    - Last two steps are mostly for getting it to prod for delivery of the assignment

12. If the attached issues don't close wait until the next step
13. Merge the updated dev branch into your production branch via a pull request
14. Close any related issues that didn't auto close

    - You can edit the dropdown on the issue or drag/drop it to the proper column on the project board
