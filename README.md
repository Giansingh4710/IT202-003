[Suduko Game](https://gs4-prod.herokuapp.com/)

For my IT202 class I make a suduko game. The game has many many features. You can make an account and login.
You can generate points on that account by solving the suduko puzzles. You can also make and join competetions and compete with fellow sudukors. If the board is too hard to solve, you can see the solved version but it will cost you points. The website is built with php
javascript, html and has a sql data base.
